# WebApi_Practice

This is just a brief practice to know how to use webApi using Asp.NET Core 3.1 - Codes may not be standard. but the important thing is how my WebApi works!! ðŸ˜‰

Moreover, I use Unit Testing in WebApi.

In addition, I use Memory Caching in WebApi.. but I commented all the lines just before push it here.
